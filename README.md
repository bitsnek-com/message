Hi bitsnek,

I wanted to chat with you about the username "bitsnek".

I'm actually in the process of starting a business under the name "bitsnek." I own the domain bitsnek.com, along with the Telegram handle @bitsnek and the Instagram account @bitsnek. To maintain consistency and strengthen our brand's online presence, it would be awesome if I could secure the username "bitsnek" across all platforms.

Since you don't seem to be using it actively yet, I was wondering if you would consider releasing the username to me. It would genuinely help me out and align everything perfectly for my upcoming business venture.

Thanks a ton for considering it, and I hope we can work something out!

Email: florian@bitsnek.com

Best regards,

Florian
